Chess project requires particular modifications as follows:
1. Constatnt variables related to certain class are in separate file.
2. There exists separate class with global functions
		( it looks like author couldn't manage space for it somewhere
			in appriopriate class)
3. There is not applied any architectural pattern.
4. Implementation doesn't take advantage of modern C++.
5. BoardData class is too big
6. There is lack of identification of moves ( first of all program needs to 
		identify move and then make actions accordingly to that knowledge)
7. Get rid of id.
8. too much data stored.
9. Bridge pattern design could be applied here.
10. Extract extrinsic values from objects ( useful flyweight design pattern ).
